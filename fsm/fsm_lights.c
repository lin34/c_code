Challenge: write a traffic light control system using a finite state machine. Assume it is a four way intersection.
THere should be a push button event signalling to transition to the next state
For simplificationt here will be no timer to transition between states

step 1. draw the state diagram
define states and transitions
Step 2 code the state machine
