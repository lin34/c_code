Question 2 of 6

Customers and their orders are stored in the following two tables:

TABLE customers

id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL

name VARCHAR(50)

balance DECIMAL (10,2)

TABLE orders

id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL

customerId INTEGER NOT NULL

product VARCHAR(100)

FOREIGN KEY (customerId) REFERENCES customers(id)

Using a sub-query, delete the orders of any customer whose balance is negative.


Answer
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE customerId IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM customers
    WHERE balance < 0
);
